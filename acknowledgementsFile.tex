First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Vince Vatter. His patient guidance and support has led me from an undergraduate student who knew not of graduate school to where I am today. Vince has shaped how I explore and communicate mathematics, and I look forward to learning more from him in the future.

Thanks are due to Jay Pantone, who has always met my questions with kindness and wisdom. I would also like to give thanks to Michael Albert and Robert Brignall for many fruitful and enlightening conversations. 

I would like to thank Fr\'ed\'erique Bassino for supervising me during my research fellowship in Paris. Thanks also go to Andrea Sportiello for his enthusiasm and ideas during our discussions. I am grateful to Axel Bacher for his time and effort performing computations beyond my capability, the results of which I hope to one day understand.

Finally, I am immensely grateful and appreciative for the support and encouragement from my partner Amanda. She has helped me become a better version of myself in so many ways, and words cannot convey how thankful I am to have her in my life.
