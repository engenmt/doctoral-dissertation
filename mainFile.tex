%% Uncomment the relevant line below if you have tables or figures.
\haveTablestrue   % Uncomment this if you have tables in your thesis.
\haveFigurestrue  % Uncomment this if you have figures in your thesis.
%\haveObjectstrue % Uncomment this if you have Objects in your thesis. This is almost certainly not the case however.

%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair. 
%     Most of these are self explanatory. 
%     Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a cochair. 
%       So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%       If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\title{Universal Combinatorial Structures}%  Put your title here.

\degreeType{Doctor of Philosophy} % Official name of your degree; e.g. "Doctor of Philosophy".
\major{Mathematics}                 % Your official Department
\author{Michael Engen}              % Your Name
\thesisType{Dissertation}           % Dissertation (PhD) or Thesis (Masters)
\degreeYear{2021}                   % Intended graduation year (not the year you submit the thesis)
\degreeMonth{August}                % Month of graduation should be May, August, or December.
\chair{Vincent Vatter}              % Chair and Cochair (see comment block above).

%%% For each of the following, type in the name of the file that contains each section. 
%       They are assumed to be tex files, but if they aren't the command takes an optional argument for the extension.
%       So, you could load dedication.tex as your dedication file using \setDedicationFile{dedication}
%       You could load dedication.txt instead with \setDedicationFile[txt]{dedication}.
%       NOTE: For some compilers they may or may not add a .tex to the end of the file automatically.
%           If you get a "couldn't find dedication.tex.tex" type error, try the command with an empty optional argument,
%           e.g. \setDedicationFile[]{dedication}
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% These are REQUIRED sections; easiest to do via these commands.

\setDedicationFile{dedicationFile}            % Dedication Page
\setAcknowledgementsFile{acknowledgementsFile}% Acknowledgements Page
\setAbstractFile{abstractFile}                % Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)
\setReferenceFile{referenceFile}{apalike}     % References. 
                                              % The first argument is your bibtex source file
                                              % The second argument is your bibtex style file.
\setBiographicalFile{biographyFile}           % Biography file of the Author (you).

%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.

%\setAbbreviationsFile{abbreviations} % Abbreviations Page
\setAppendixFile{appendix-tables}     % Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird.
\multipleAppendixtrue                 % Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix, 
%                                     % Comment it if you have only one appendix.
