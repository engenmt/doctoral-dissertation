\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap-conclusion}

In this chapter, we present some additional problems related to universality. As remarked in Chapter~\ref{chap-introduction}, each $n$-structure considered in this work contains at most $\binom{n}{m}$ many $m$-structures, as any substructure of size $m$ corresponds to a subset of entries of size $m$. One may ask more generally, ``what is the maximum number of $m$-structures that an $n$-structure may contain?'' In~\cite{bevan:prolific-permut:}, Bevan, Homberger, and Tenner prove there are $n$-permutations that attain the above binomial bound, meaning they contain $\binom{n}{m}$ many $m$-permutations, if and only if $n \ge \ceil{(n-m)^2/2 + 2(n-m) + 1}$.  Focusing on permutations, let $\Cont(n,m)$ denote the maximum number of $m$-permutations that any $n$-permutation contains. Figure~\ref{fig-perm-max-contain} displays known values of $\Cont(m+k,m)$ for small $m$ and $k$. The cells with dark gray backgrounds contain values where $\Cont(m+k,m) = m!$, meaning there are $m$-universal permutations of size $m+k$. The cells with white backgrounds contain values so that $\Cont(m+k,m) = \binom{m+k}{m}$. We are grateful to Axel Bacher~[private communication] for computing many of these values.

Given a set of structures $\S$, and let $\Cont_{\S}(n, m)$ denote the maximum number of $\S_m$-structures that any $n$-structure may contain. Likewise, let $\Cont_{\S}^p(n, m)$ denote the maximum number of $\S_m$-structures that any $\S_n$-structure may contain. As a case study, consider the poset $\T$ of words over the two-letter alphabet $\{\worda, \wordb\}$ under the subword ordering. In this case, we may provide an exact formula for the maximum number of words of size $m$ that any word in $\T_n$ may contain.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop-word-max-contain}
For all $n, m$, the maximum number of $m$-words contained in a $\T_n$-word is
\[
    \Cont_{\T}(n,m) 
    = 
    \sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m} \binom{m}{\ell}.
\]
\end{proposition}
Before proving Proposition~\ref{prop-word-max-contain}, we note that the formula provided equals $2^{m}$ precisely when $n \ge 2m$, which is implied by Theorem~\ref{prop-word-universal}.
\begin{proof}
To begin, we obtain an recursive formula for the number of $m$-words contained in a word $w$ of size $n$ for $n > m$. If $w$ contains only $\worda$ or only $\wordb$, then $w$ contains only the constant word of size $m$. Otherwise, $w$ contains both $\worda$ and $\wordb$, and without loss of generality we can assume that $w$ ends in $\worda$ and write $w = w_0 \wordb \worda^k$. 

For each word $v$ that $w$ contains that ends in $\wordb$, there is some embedding of $v$ into $w$ that places the final letter of $v$ into the final $\wordb$ of $w$, and thus the set of $m$-words contained in $w$ that end in $\wordb$ is in bijection with the set of $(m-1)$-words contained in $w_0$. Likewise, the set of $m$-words contained in $w$ that end in $\worda$ is in bijection with the set of $(m-1)$-words contained in $w_0 \wordb \worda^{k-1}$. % Let $\cont_w(m)$ denote the number of $m$-words contained in $w$. 
We have shown that 
\[
    \binom{\text{$\#$ of $m$-words}}{\text{contained in $w$}}
    =
    \binom{\text{$\#$ of $(m-1)$-words}}{\text{contained in $w_0$}}
    +
    \binom{\text{$\#$ of $(m-1)$-words}}{\text{contained in $w_0 \wordb \worda^{k-1}$}}.
\]
% \[
%     \cont_{w}(m) 
%     = 
%     \cont_{w_0}(m-1) + \cont_{w_0 \wordb \worda^{k-1}}(m-1).
% \]

This formula implies an upper bound on the quantity $\Cont_{\T}(n,m)$. As $w_0$ has size at most $n-2$ and $w_0 \wordb \worda^{k-1}$ has size at most $n-1$, we have
\begin{align*}
    \binom{\text{$\#$ of $m$-words}}{\text{contained in $w$}}
        &= \binom{\text{$\#$ of $(m-1)$-words}}{\text{contained in $w_0$}}
         + \binom{\text{$\#$ of $(m-1)$-words}}{\text{contained in $w_0 \wordb \worda^{k-1}$}} \\
        &\le \Cont_{\T}(n-2,m-1) + \Cont_{\T}(n-1,m-1)
\end{align*}
for all words $w$. Thus the maximum number of $m$-words contained among all words in $\T_n$ obeys this bound as well, and thus we have
\[
    \Cont_{\T}(n,m)
    \le
    \Cont_{\T}(n-2,m-1) + \Cont_{\T}(n-1,m-1).
\]

To establish equality, we exhibit a word $w_n$ of size $n$ that attains this upper bound. For each $n \ge 0$, let $w_n$ be the word of size $n$ wherein each letter in an odd position is $\worda$ and each letter in an even position is $\wordb$, e.g. $w_0 = \varepsilon$, $w_1 = \worda$, $w_2 = \worda \wordb$, $w_3 = \worda \wordb \worda$, and so on. Let $\cont(n, m)$ denote the number of $m$-words contained in $w_n$.

We claim that for all $n$, $\cont(n, m) = \Cont_{\T}(n, m)$, and proceed by induction on $m$. For our base case of $m = 0$, every word contains the unique empty word, so $\cont(n, 0) = \Cont_{\T}(n, 0) = 1$. Now, assume that for all $n$ we have $\cont(n, m') = \Cont_{\T}(n, m')$ for all $m' < m$. By the recursive formula at the beginning of this proof, we have
\begin{align*}
    \cont(n, m)
        &= \cont(n-1, m-1) + \cont(n-2, m-1) \\
        &= \Cont_{\T}(n-1, m-1) + \Cont_{\T}(n-2, m-1) \\
        &\ge \Cont_{\T}(n,m).
\end{align*}
As $w_n$ is a word of size $n$, we have that $\cont(n,m) \le \Cont_{\T}(n,m)$, and thus we have equality:
\[
    \cont(n, m)
    =
    \Cont_{\T}(n,m)
    =
    \Cont_{\T}(n-1,m-1) + \Cont_{\T}(n-1,m-1).
\]

It only remains to show that for all $n$,
\[
    \Cont_{\T}(n,m)
    = 
    \sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m} \binom{m}{\ell},
\]
which we show by induction on $m$.

For all $n$, we have $\Cont_{\T}(n,0) = \binom{0}{0} + \binom{0}{1} + \cdots + \binom{0}{n-m} = 1 + 0 + \cdots + 0 = 1$. Fix $m \ge 1$, and assume that the statement holds for all values less than $m$. Then we have
\begin{align*}
    \Cont_{\T}(n,m) 
        &= \Cont_{\T}(n-1,m-1) + \Cont_{\T}(n-2,m-1) \\
        &= \sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m} \binom{m-1}{\ell} + \sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m-1} \binom{m-1}{\ell} \\
        &= \binom{m-1}{0} + \sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m-1} \left[ \binom{m-1}{\ell+1} + \binom{m-1}{\ell} \right] \\
        &= \binom{m}{0} + \sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m-1} \binom{m}{\ell+1} \\
        &= \binom{m}{0} + \sum_{\ell = 1}^{n-m} \binom{m}{\ell} \\
        &= \sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m} \binom{m}{\ell},
\end{align*}
as desired.
\end{proof}

Values of $\Cont_{\T}(m+k,m)$ for small values of $m$ and $k$ are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig-max-contain-words}. The recurrence proven in the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop-word-max-contain} may be interpreted in this context as ``the value in a cell is equal to the sum of the values in the cells immediately to its west and to its south-west''. As in Figure~\ref{fig-perm-max-contain}, the cells with dark gray backgrounds correspond to universality, and the cells with white backgrounds contain values so that $\Cont_{\T}(m+k,m) = \binom{m+k}{m}$.

By the isomorphism between the poset of words over a two-letter alphabet and the poset $\W$ of non-empty wedge permutations in Proposition~\ref{prop-perm-wedge-isomorphism}, the maximum number of $\W_m$-permutations that any $\W_n$-permutation may contain is $\sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m} \binom{m-1}{\ell}$. Computation suggests that the maximum number of $\W_m$-permutations contained by \emph{any} permutation of size $n$ is $\sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m} \binom{m-1}{\ell}$ as well.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj-max-contain-w}
For all $m$ and $n$, the maximum number of $\W_m$-permutations contained by any permutation of size $n$ is
\[
    \sum_{\ell = 0}^{n-m} \binom{m-1}{\ell}.
\]
